- [DOGM204e display](https://www.lcd-module.de/fileadmin/eng/pdf/doma/dogm204e.pdf)

## Software

This program is written in C using the Keil Microvision IDE and PEMicro debugger.

Additional software resources include:

- [IFTTT web hook service](https://ifttt.com/)

Python scripts are also included in this project, hosted on a local computer, to log security breaches and connect to the IFTTT service.
